Notes for myself:

For each on note:
    Move backwards in time based on the velocity.
    Light notes take more time then heavy note.
    Once the light notes are biased:
        Some minimum time between on and the next off, otherwise it turns off before it hits. (See bia?)
        Minumum time between off and the next on, allowing keys to reset. If keys are to fast it cant hit.
